Diabetes Prediction Using Decision Trees

This Python script demonstrates the use of decision trees for predicting diabetes. It utilizes the `DecisionTreeClassifier` from scikit-learn to create two decision tree models based on different criteria: entropy and Gini index. The dataset includes information about individuals such as age, gender, smoking history, BMI, HbA1c level, blood glucose level, and diabetes status.


Key Features:

Loads a dataset containing information about individuals.
Preprocesses the dataset by encoding categorical variables and normalizing numerical features.
Performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) by visualizing the dataset using a pairplot.
Splits the dataset into training and testing sets.
Builds two decision tree models using entropy and Gini index as criteria.
Evaluates the models using accuracy score and classification report.
Visualizes the decision tree model using the plot_tree function.


Usage:
Ensure Python is installed along with the necessary libraries (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn).
Clone the repository and navigate to the directory.
Run the script in a Python environment (e.g., Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab).
