Diabetes Prediction Using Decision Trees

This Python script demonstrates the use of decision trees for predicting diabetes. It utilizes the `DecisionTreeClassifier` from scikit-learn to create two decision tree models based on different criteria: entropy and Gini index. The dataset includes information about individuals such as age, gender, smoking history, BMI, HbA1c level, blood glucose level, and diabetes status.
